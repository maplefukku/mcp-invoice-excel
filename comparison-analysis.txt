## POTENTIAL VISUAL IMPACT:

### Critical Issues:
1. **Data Mismatches**: The pricing shows 100,000 in the unit price but calculates to 20,000 in the total - this suggests incorrect data population.

2. **Missing Formatting Properties**: The "shrinkToFit" property differences could cause text to appear differently in cells, especially if the content doesn't fit the cell width.

3. **Text Wrapping**: Email cell formatting differences could affect how the email address displays.

### Minor Issues:
1. **Date Values**: Different dates will be visible to users
2. **Content Values**: Different company names and item descriptions
3. **Page Setup**: First page numbering difference (likely not visible)

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Verify Data Population Logic**: Check why unit price shows 100,000 but total calculates to 20,000
2. **Preserve All Alignment Properties**: Ensure "shrinkToFit" and other formatting properties are fully preserved
3. **Check Text Wrapping**: Verify email display formatting
4. **Validate Content Mapping**: Ensure correct data is being populated in each field

The most significant issues are the data inconsistencies and missing formatting properties that could affect visual appearance.
